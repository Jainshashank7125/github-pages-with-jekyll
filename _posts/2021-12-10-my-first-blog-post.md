Today we will discuss about the CLoud Services : 

   Cloud services are infrastructure, platforms, or software that are hosted by third-party providers and made available to users through the internet. 
   Cloud services facilitate the flow of user data from front-end clients (e.g. users’ servers, tablets, desktops, laptops—anything on the users’ ends), through the internet, to the provider’s systems, and back. Users can access cloud services with nothing more than a computer, operating system, and internet connectivity or virtual private network (VPN).
